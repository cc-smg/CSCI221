This program is a small text-based game where you navigate through the forest.
It will save your journey to a text file as well.

Instructions for how to begin:
First, type "make game" into the terminal to compile the game.cpp file using the provided Makefile.
Then, to start the game, simply type "./game adventure.txt". adventure.txt is a blank text file provided, but you can use any text file. Just be aware that the program will remove any text already in the file.
That's it! You're ready to play!

Instructions for gameplay:
Typing "help" while in the game will bring up a list of commands that you can enter to do something in the game. Use all lowercase, with no extra spaces.
Items have no practical use. All items you have collected are viewed at the end in a fun list though!
Trying to move in a direction it is stated there is nothing in will simply bring you back to the location you were already in.

That should be everything you need to know! Have fun!
